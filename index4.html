                <h2>What is Git?</h2>
                <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code,
                collaborate with others, and manage their projects effectively. It helps in maintaining the history of
                changes made to files, making it easier to revert to previous versions if needed.</p>

                <h2>Key features of Git:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Version Control: Track changes to files over time, allowing for easy retrieval of previous
                        versions.</li>
                    <li>Branching: Create separate branches for features or fixes, enabling parallel development without
                        affecting the main codebase.</li>
                    <li>Merging: Combine changes from different branches, making it easier to integrate new features.</li>
                    <li>Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously, with Git
                        managing the changes.</li>
                    <li>History Tracking: View the complete history of changes made to a project, including who made
                        each change and why.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Basic Git Commands</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>git init:</strong> Initialize a new Git repository.</li>
                    <li><strong>git clone [repository]:</strong> Clone an existing repository to your local machine.</li>

                <h2>What is Github?</h2>
                <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store, manage, and track their code repositories, making it easier to work on projects both individually and as part of a team. GitHub provides a user-friendly interface and a range of features that enhance productivity and facilitate collaboration among developers.</p>

                <h2>Key Features of Github:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Version Control:</strong>Keep track of changes in your code. You can go back to previous versions if something goes wrong.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repositories:</strong> Store your projects in separate folders called repositories (repos). Each repo holds all your project files and history and can have its own issues, pull requests, and wiki pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Work with others easily. Many people can contribute to the same project without interfering with each other's work.</li>
