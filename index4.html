                <h1>Git</h1>
                <h2>What is Git?</h2>
                <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code,
                    collaborate with others, and manage their projects effectively. It helps in maintaining the history
                    of
                    changes made to files, making it easier to revert to previous versions if needed.</p>

                <h2>Key features of Git:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Track changes to files over time, allowing for easy retrieval
                        of previous
                        versions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Branching:</strong> Create separate branches for features or fixes, enabling parallel
                        development without affecting the main codebase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merging:</strong> Combine changes from different branches, making it easier to integrate
                        new features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously,
                        with Git
                        managing the changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>History Tracking:</strong> View the complete history of changes made to a project,
                        including who made
                        each change and why.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Basic Git Commands</h2>
                <ul>

                <h1>Github</h1>
                <h2>What is Github?</h2>
                <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration. It allows
                    developers to store, manage, and track their code repositories, making it easier to work on projects
                    both individually and as part of a team. GitHub provides a user-friendly interface and a range of
                    features that enhance productivity and facilitate collaboration among developers.</p>

                <h2>Key Features of Github:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Version Control:</strong>Keep track of changes in your code. You can go back to previous
                        versions if something goes wrong.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repositories:</strong> Store your projects in separate folders called repositories
                        (repos). Each repo holds all your project files and history and can have its own issues, pull
                        requests, and wiki pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Work with others easily. Many people can contribute to the same
                        project without interfering with each other's work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Suggest changes to the code and get feedback from others before
                        those changes are added. It's like asking for permission to make changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Issues:</strong> Report bugs or request new features. Use issues to discuss what needs
                        to be fixed or added to the project.</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub Actions:</strong> Automate tasks like testing code or deploying apps without
                        manual work. It helps streamline your development process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community:</strong> Join millions of developers around the world. Share your projects,
                        contribute to others, and learn from the community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Write clear instructions and information about your projects.
                        Use markdown files to make it easy to read.</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> Create simple websites for free. You can host your project or
                        personal website directly from GitHub./li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Get alerts about security issues in your code. GitHub helps you keep
                        your projects safe from vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Use Github?</h2>
                <p>Here's a simplified explanation of how to use GitHub for beginners:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Create an Account:</strong> Sign up for a free GitHub account to start using the
                        platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a Repository:</strong>A repository (or repo) is like a folder for your project.
                        Click on the "New" button to create a repo, give it a name, and choose whether it should be
                        public or private.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upload Your Code:</strong>You can add files to your repo directly from the website or by
                        using Git on your computer.Use the "Upload files" button or drag and drop files to add them.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Make Changes:</strong>Edit your files right in the browser or on your computer.If you
                        make changes locally, remember to commit them with a message explaining what you did.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Branches:</strong>Create branches to work on new features without affecting the main
                        code.You can switch between branches to manage different versions of your project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborate with Others:</strong>Invite others to work on your repo by adding them as
                        collaborators.You can also contribute to other people's projects by forking their repos and

                        project, create a pull request. This allows others to review your changes and suggest
                        improvements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Track Issues:</strong>Use the "Issues" tab to report bugs or suggest features. This
                        helps keep track of what needs to be fixed or added.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review Changes:</strong>Check the "Commits" history to see all the changes made in the
                        repo. You can revert to earlier versions if necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Github Pages:</strong>If you want to create a simple website, you can use GitHub
                        Pages to host it for free.</li>
